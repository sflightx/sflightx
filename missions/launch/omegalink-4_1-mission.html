    <title>sFlightX - Preparing the Block Five</title>

    <p><b>Maya Block 5</b> successfully lifted off on June 07, 11:30 UTC at Bataan Space Center.
        The payload for this mission was <b>@OmegaLink</b>'s 5 Omega Satellites to Low Earth Orbit.</p>
    <p>Tower communications went flawlessly at the start of the countdown. 
        Shortly after the road was closed fuel loading started at T-30 minutes and propellant loading went according to plan. 
        This enables us for a faster turnaround as we seek to have a faster launch cadence by building more towers at the launch complex.</p>
    <p>At T-3s, all Agila Engines successfully ignited and the access arm retracted. As Maya ascended, the launch mount was toasted and needs major refurmishment, such as installing a water cooled steel plate. The plate provides flowing water the suppresses vibration that caused damage to the pad.</p>
    <p>Maya also passed Max-Q, or where the rocket experiences the greatest amount of stress as the rocket accelerates and the density of the atmosphere is really dense.</p>
    <p>The stage separation went nominally not until boostback burn. Computer software commanded the first stage to execute the flip and boostback burn, however the fuel sloshed thus damaging the engines and B2010 experienced a <b>Vehicle Unscheduled Disassembly</b> or VUR.</p>
    <p>Future boosters will now be equipped baffle plates inside, as well as B2011, B2012 and B2013 which are Maya Heavy cores used for <b>@ZastenX</b>'s ObSat-1 Mission.</p>
    <p>With flights like these, we learn from our failures as we gather precious data from Maya Block 5. Congratulations to the sFlightX teams for successful Block 5 demonstration!</p>
