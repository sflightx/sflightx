    <title>Teams Gearing Up For Flight 4</title>

    <h4>Teams are now targeting June 07, 11:10 UTC for OmegaLink 4-1 Mission carrying 5 Omega Satellites to Low Earth Orbit. The flight objective for this test is to enter nominal orbit using the brand-new Maya Block 5 version.</h4>
    <p>sFlightX is set to launch the OmegaLink 2-3 mission on the fourth flight of Maya. This payload, OmegaSat, "this satellite constellation will provide low-latency communications from any point of Earth" company says.</p>
    <p>The vehicle involved this mission is Booster SN404, not a "not found" booster, but rather a fourth generation, and 04 in production line. Most structural upgrades are present here than Booster SN403, the third flight booster.</p>
    <p>Booster SN403 did well, as it impacted the ground 45m/s with only collapsing the engine bay, and not exploding.</p>    <p>Due to payload limitations, this will carry another 1 OmegaSat to space. Future versions will improve, and will extend its payload capacity. Maya Heavy can launch 5 Sats in expendable mode.</p>
    <p>The next flight is planned, with the first stage set to soft splashdown 30km downrange the launch site. This will enable us to make Maya a rapid reusable vehicle for the future.</p>
